## Description:

Write a function that takes in a string of one or more words, and returns the same string, but with all five or more letter words reversed (like the name of this kata).

- Strings passed in will consist of only letters and spaces.
- Spaces will be included only when more than one word is present.

## Examples:

```
spinWords("Hey fellow warriors") => "Hey wollef sroirraw" 
spinWords("This is a test") => "This is a test" 
spinWords("This is another test") => "This is rehtona test"
```
