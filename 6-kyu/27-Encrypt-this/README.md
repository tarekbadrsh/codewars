You are given a secret message you need to decipher. Here are the things you need to know to decipher it:

For each word:

- the second and the last letter is switched (e.g. `Hello` becomes `Holle`)
- the first letter is replaced by its character code (e.g. `H` becomes `72`)

Note: there are no special characters used, only letters and spaces

Examples
```
decipherThis('72olle 103doo 100ya'); // 'Hello good day'
decipherThis('82yade 115te 103o'); // 'Ready set go'
```
