The idea for this Kata came from 9gag today [![here](https://9gag.com/gag/amrb4r9)](https://9gag.com/gag/amrb4r9).


You'll have to translate a string to Pilot's alphabet (NATO phonetic alphabet) [![wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet).



Like this:

*Input* : If you can read

*Output* : India Foxtrot Yankee Oscar Uniform Charlie Alfa November Romeo Echo Alfa Delta.

### Some notes

* Keep the punctuation, and remove the spaces.
* Use Xray without dash or space.

### Reference

alt text

You can use the NATO hash with the alphabet.
