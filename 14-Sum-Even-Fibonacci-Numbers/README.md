# [![Sum Even Fibonacci Numbers](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-even-fibonacci-numbers)](https://www.codewars.com/kata/sum-even-fibonacci-numbers)


* Write a func named SumEvenFibonacci that takes a parameter of type int and returns a value of type int

* Generate all of the Fibonacci numbers starting with 1 and 2 and ending on the highest number before exceeding the parameter's value

Each new number in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two numbers - by starting with 1 and 2(the input could be smaller), the first 10 numbers will be:

```
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...
```

* Sum all of the even numbers you generate and return that int

### Example:
```
sumEvenFibonacci(8) // returns 10 by adding the even values 2 and 8
```
